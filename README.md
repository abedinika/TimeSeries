In a time series problem, we aim to predict the future based on the data provided in the past. Actually, considering the recent past, we are able to predict the sales or market in the future. In the dataset provided by Au-dela, 3 features are presented as Val_1, Val_2 and Val_3. Despite the few number of available samples in the dataset, some statistical methods employed to predict the 4 steps ahead of the sequence of the data points. It is worth to say that since the performance of system is not matter in the scope of this project, conducting a research on the most common available method for time series prediction is the priority of this report. In addition, the solution aims to illustrate the style of coding on python and using object-oriented programming with respect to solving time series forecasting. With this in mind, the provided solution in both report and code files is not the most effective and recommended algorithm, while deep learning methods such as recurrent neural network based on LSTM architecture would be better mean.
